    <p>Ingredients<br>
3 cups all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled <br>
1 teaspoon baking soda <br>
2 teaspoons cream of tartar <br>
½ teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature <br>
½ cup light brown sugar <br>
1¼ cups granulated sugar <br>
2 large eggs <br>
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract <br>
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
</p>

    <h3>Directions <br>
1. Heat oven to 375° F. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar, and salt.<br>


2. With an electric mixer, beat the butter, brown sugar, and 1 cup of the granulated sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs and vanilla. Reduce speed to low and gradually add the flour mixture, mixing just until incorporated.<br>


3. In a shallow bowl, combine the cinnamon and the remaining ¼ cup of granulated sugar. Form the dough into balls (each equal to 1 level tablespoon). Roll the balls in the cinnamon sugar mixture and place on parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing them 2 inches apart.<br>


4. Bake until the edges are golden, 12 to 14 minutes. Cool slightly on the baking sheets, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely.</h3>
